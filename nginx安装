#1、brew search nginx   //查询要安装的软件是否存在

#2、brew info nginx  查看nginx安装信息
nginx: stable 1.17.3 (bottled), HEAD
HTTP(S) server and reverse proxy, and IMAP/POP3 proxy server
https://nginx.org/
Not installed
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/nginx.rb
==> Dependencies
Required: openssl@1.1 ✘, pcre ✘
==> Options
--HEAD
	Install HEAD version
==> Caveats
Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:
  brew services start nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  nginx
